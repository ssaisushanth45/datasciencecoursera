NBA Shot Log Analyzer - Data
========================================================

My choice of dataset & application was based on four things:

- Simple to understand
- Fun to play with
- An opportunity to learn something new
- Useful in building my portfolio for my start-up (Spanstatz)

Research on publicly available data sets led me to Dan Becker's Kaggle posting:
<https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/nba-shot-logs>

I wanted to create an interactive R Shiny app based on this data to learn and play with something I am passionate about.

As a next step, I hope to add shot chart visualization to this app and may be stretch across to handle different sports (FIFA, NHL, Cricket etc.).

NBA Shot Log Analyzer - Charts - Closer View
========================================================
class: smaller

- As a LeBron James fan who has seen him play for St.Vincents at the Gund (now, Quicken) Arena, I had to start by looking at his numbers.

- App is set for 4 charts: Home vs. Away, Win vs. Loss, By Distance (as Table - just for kicks) and By defender. Embedded code shows only 2 here.
