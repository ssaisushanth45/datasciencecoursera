# Human Activity Recognition

## Data Subject and Source
Human Activity Recognition - HAR - has emerged as a key research area in the last years and is gaining increasing 
attention by the pervasive computing research community especially for the development of context-aware systems. 
There are many potential applications for HAR, like: elderly monitoring, life log systems for monitoring energy 
expenditure and for supporting weight-loss programs, and digital assistants for weight lifting exercises. Read more:

We will using the Weight Lifting Exercise dataset and apply machine learning to predict the manner in which test 
subjects did their exercise. Data and background sourced from : http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har
